Problem Statement

The limited availability of high-quality training data, driven by privacy restrictions, high collection expenses, and the shortcomings of traditional augmentation techniques, highlights the critical need for scalable synthetic data creation that maintains semantic depth and preserves correlations across various data types.

Abstract

This project introduces an integrated Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) system designed to produce high-quality synthetic datasets for structured (tabular) and unstructured (text, image, audio) data, tailored to user-specified needs. The platform merges several GAN models—CTGAN for tabular data, conditional GAN and diffusion-based approaches for images, and transformer-GAN combinations for text—within a flexible, modular pipeline. A user requirement interpreter supports conditional data creation, enabling specification of schema rules or detailed prompts. The system incorporates thorough evaluation criteria for accuracy, variety, and privacy, ensuring the synthetic data mirrors the original’s statistical properties while remaining distinct. This solution promotes secure data exchange, repeatable research, and unbiased model training across fields.

Proposed Solution

The suggested pipeline includes four key components:





Preprocessing Layer: Manages feature scaling, encoding, and normalization for both structured and unstructured inputs.



Generation Layer: Utilizes CTGAN for tabular data and StyleGAN/TextGAN variants for unstructured data, accommodating conditional inputs.



Evaluation Layer: Evaluates output data with statistical similarity tests (KS-test, correlation metrics), perceptual quality measures (FID, BLEU), and privacy checks (membership inference tests).



User Interface Layer: Provides a REST API or Streamlit-based dashboard for users to set requirements and access generated datasets along with performance summaries.

Expected Outcome

The project seeks to provide a comprehensive synthetic data generation system that:





Produces realistic structured and unstructured data in line with user specifications.



Maintains statistical distributions and data relationships while protecting privacy.



Delivers automated evaluation reports detailing data accuracy and variety.



Supplies a deployable, scalable tool for researchers and developers to create tailored synthetic datasets for model development and testing.
